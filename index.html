    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Futurerestore is a tool that allows iOS devices to upgrade, downgrade, or re-restore to an unsigned iOS firmware using SHSH blobs. This is a guide will go over how to use Futurerestore, and the different methods you can use to restore your device to an unsigned firmware.</p>
    <p>This guide is based off of <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WHuwuvnkcEUCwaDuck2dy-MR7q4em38uL4_4Utx2QZ8/mobilebasic" rel="nofollow">this one</a>, except it has been made into a website with better formating, making it much more simple to read and easier to follow.</p> 
    <p>Know that if you decide to follow this guide, take everything you read into consideration and be careful! <strong>No one</strong> will be held responsible for any damage <strong>YOU</strong> cause to your device, whether it was caused by you using the wrong file, or the wrong command.</p>

    <h2>Background Info</h2>
    <p>Before you begin following this guide, keep in mind that:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>This guide is targeted to people who (as of August 2019) want to use Futurerestore to upgrade, downgrade, or re-restore to iOS 12.2. This doesn't make this guide limited to those users only, as the process is the same for other devices/firmwares, but with slight modifications.</li>
        <li>As of August 2019, <strong>iOS 12.4's SEP and Baseband are fully compatible when upgrading, downgrading, or re-restoring to iOS 12.2, and the "fortnight bug" does NOT occur.</strong> This means that you can safely use the latest SEP and Baseband, instead of manually specifying a compatible SEP and Baseband when restoring, without having to worry about your device not functioning after 2 weeks.</li>
        <li><strong>If you're a Windows user</strong>, make sure iTunes and its drivers are installed correctly. This is very critical to you, as you want to avoid having the Microsoft Store version of iTunes.</li>
        <li>If you decide to use a backup after using Futurerestore, make sure that you have gone through the process of getting rid of your jailbreak before backing up your jailbroken device. Modern jailbreaks have an option named "Restore RootFS" that can help you with this.</li>
        <li>This process does not work for 32-bit Windows users. Sorry!</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Getting ready to Restore</h2>
    <p>In order to futurerestore to your desired firmware, there are a few things you will need, such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/s0uthwest/futurerestore/releases" rel="nofollow">Futurerestore</a>'s latest released version</li>
        <li>Your SHSH blob file from <a href="https://tsssaver.1conan.com/" rel="nofollow">TSSSaver</a> (If you're unsure as to which file you should download, head to the <code>noapnonce</code> folder, and download your blob from there)</li>
        <li>The IPSW containing an SEP and Baseband that is compatible with the version you're going to upgrade, downgrade, or re-restore to. If you're looking for beta firmwares, you can find them <a href="https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Beta_Firmware" rel="nofollow">here</a>, otherwise, head over to <a href="https://ipsw.me" rel="nofollow">ipsw.me</a> to obtain officially released firmwares</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you're going to specify your SEP and Baseband, you'll be required to extract the IPSW that contains the SEP and Baseband that is compatible with the version you're restoring to and obtain:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A <code>.im4w</code> file containing the boardconfig identifier of your device (This is your SEP)</li>
        <li>A <code>.bbtw</code> file containing the iOS version number of the IPSW (This is your baseband)</li>
        <li>The <code>BuildManifest.plist</code> file from said IPSW</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can use <a href="https://extract.me/" rel="nofollow">extract.me</a> to get these files without having to actually extract the entire IPSW.</p>
    <p>Once you have all of the files, its a good practice to put them inside <strong>one folder</strong>, which is often named <code>futurerestore</code>.</p>

    <h3>Finding your Nonce Generator</h3>
    <p>Finding your nonce generator and setting it is a critical step when attempting to Futurerestore, as that generator is essesially one of the main components that will allow you to Futurerestore to your desired firmware.</p>
    <p>In order to find your nonce generator:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Open your downloaded blob from TSSSaver with any kind of text editor</li>
        <li><strong>(On Windows)</strong> Press <code>Ctrl + F</code>, <strong>(On macOS)</strong> Press <code>Command + F</code>, then search for the word "generator</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Next to, or underneath the generator, you will see that there's a string of (around) 16 characters.Please save this string inside a text file that should also be inside your <code>futurerestore</code> folder. You will use this string later.</p>

    <h3>Setting your Nonce Generator</h3>
    <p>Now that you have found your nonce generator, its time to set it on your device. There are many nonce setters out there, which support many different firmwares. Here's a list of the most commonly used, made by known developers:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/Siguza/PhoenixNonce" rel="nofollow">Ph≈ìnixNonce</a> for iOS 9.x.</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/julioverne/julioverne.github.io/blob/master/debfiles/com.julioverne.nonceset_0.4_iphoneos-arm.deb" rel="nofollow">NonceSet</a> for iOS 10.x.</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/julioverne/NonceSet112" rel="nofollow">NonceSet1112</a> for iOS 11 - 11.1.2.</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/GeoSn0w/GeoNonceSetter12/releases" rel="nofollow">GeoNonceSetter12</a> for iOS 12 - 12.2.</li>
        <li><a href="http://cydia.saurik.com/package/xyz.xninja.systeminfo/" rel="nofollow">System Info</a> for iOS 8, 9, 10, and 11. (Available in Cydia, or any other package manager)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Alternatively, modern jailbreak tools, such as <a href="https://github.com/pwn20wndstuff/Undecimus/releases" rel="nofollow">unc0ver</a>, or <a href="https://chimera.sh/" rel="nofollow">Chimera</a>, have an option to set a nonce generator on support firmwares, so you can use them to set your nonce as well.</p>
    <p>Here's how you can set-up your nonce:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Open your nonce setter tool (or modern jailbreak tool)</li>
        <li>Find a text field with the words "generator", "nonce" or "set nonce"</li>
        <li>Within that region, type in your key that you saved from your blob</li>
        <li>Press the "Set Nonce" button (or hit "Jailbreak" if you're using a jailbreak tool)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Once you've set your nonce generator, you're ready to begin the restoration process. Do note that if you're device powers off at this point for any reason, <strong>you will need to set up your nonce generator again.</strong></p>

    <h2>Restoration</h2>
    <p>You're finally ready to restore your device using Futurerestore. Before restoring, there are things you should keep in mind that:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Failing to disable "Find my iPhone/iPad/iPod and/or having <a href="https://cydia.akemi.ai/?page/net.angelxwind.noplsrecovery" rel="nofollow">NO PLS Recovery</a> installed before beginning the restoration process can cause the restore not to begin, or fail.</li>
        <li>If your device is put into "Recovery Mode" during this process, do not panic. This is entirely normal. However, <strong>avoid any iTunes alerts by all means, as you don't want iTunes updating, or restoring your device.</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>With that out of the way, note that are many ways you can restore to an unsinged firmware. This guide will go through most (if not, all) ways of restoring.</p>

    <h3>Common Restore (Automatic SEP & Baseband)</h3>
    <p>This method is commonly used when the latest SEP and Baseband of the latest iOS version is compatible with the version you are trying to restore to.</p>
    <p>In order to upgrade, downgrade, or re-restore using this method:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Open Command Prompt/Terminal</li>
        <li>Open your <code>futurerestore</code> folder, then drag Futurerestore into Command Prompt/Terminal, then type <code>-t</code></li>
        <li>Drag your blob file into Command Prompt/Terminal</li>
        <li>Type <code>--latest-sep --latest-baseband</code>, then drag your IPSW</li>
    </ol>
    <p>In the end, your result should look something like this (assuming your folder is on your Desktop, using Windows):</p>
    <pre><code>C:\Users\User\Desktop\futurerestore\futurerestore.exe -t [your blob] --latest-sep --latest-baseband [IPSW]</code></pre>
    <p>For <strong>iPods and Wifi-Only iPads</strong>, you should not specify the latest baseband:</p>
    <pre><code>C:\Users\User\Desktop\futurerestore\futurerestore.exe -t [your blob] --latest-sep --no-baseband [IPSW]</code></pre>
    <p>Once you are sure that you have the right command, hit "Enter" and the restore should begin.</p>

    <h3>Manually specifying SEP & Baseband</h3>
    <p>This method is used when the latest SEP and Baseband of the latest iOS version is <strong>not</strong> compatible with the version you are trying to upgrade, downgrade, or re-restore to.</p>
    <p>When specifying a "custom" SEP and Baseband, you are essensially doing so solemly because <strong>that specific SEP and Baseband is compatible with the version you're trying to upgrade, downgrade, or re-restore to.</strong></p>
    <p>In order to upgrade, downgrade, or re-restore using this method:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Open Command Prompt/Terminal</li>
        <li>Open your <code>futurerestore</code> folder, drag Futurerestore into Command Prompt/Terminal, then type <code>-t</code></li>
        <li>Drag your blob file into Command Prompt, then type <code>-s</code>, then drag your SEP file into Command Prompt/Terminal</li>
        <li>Type <code>-b</code>, then drag your baseband file intro Command Prompt/Terminal</li>
        <li>Type <code>-p</code>, then drag your BuildManifest file into Command Prompt/Terminal</li>
        <li>Type <code>-m</code>, drag your BuildManifest file (again), then drag your IPSW into Command Prompt/Terminal</li>
    </ol>
    <p>In the end, your result should look something like this (assumming your folder is in your desktop, using Windows):</p>
    <pre><code>C:\Users\User\Desktop\futurerestore\futurerestore.exe -t [your blob] -s [SEP] -b [Baseband] -p [BuildmManifest] -m [BuildManifest] [IPSW]</code></pre>
    <p>For <strong>iPods and Wifi-Only iPads</strong>, you should not specify your baseband:</p>
    <pre><code>C:\Users\User\Desktop\futurerestore\futurerestore.exe -t [your blob] -s [SEP] --no-baseband -p [BuildmManifest] -m [BuildManifest] [IPSW]</code></pre>
    <p>Once you are sure that you have the right command, hit "Enter" and the restore should begin.</p>
