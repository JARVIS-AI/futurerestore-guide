        <h1>Futurerestore's Common Errors</h1>
        <p>Of course, not everything goes as planned sometimes. You might have encounter an error when using Futurerestore in order to upgrade, downgrade or re-restore to an unsigned iOS firmware, but don't panic. There are ways you can fix these errors. </p>
        <p>This guide will help teach you how to solve common error codes you can encouter when using Futurerestore. Before continuing, keep in mind that this guide is based off of <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WHuwuvnkcEUCwaDuck2dy-MR7q4em38uL4_4Utx2QZ8/mobilebasic">this one</a>, and contains <strong>the most common</strong> Futurerestore errors. If you enconter any error not mentioned here, please refer to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/">r/Jailbreak</a>.</p>
        
        <h2>Error code -2: Could not put device in Recovery Mode</h2>
        <p>If you're on iOS 10.x, using the Meridian jailbreak, its most likely that you have encountered this error. The main reason for this is due to the jailbreak itself, as <code>ldrestart</code> in Meridian is broken. </p>
        <p>In order to fix this error on iOS 10.x: </p>
        <ol>
        <li>Download <a href="https://github.com/PsychoTea/MeridianJB/releases">Meridian</a> and sideload it with <a href="http://www.cydiaimpactor.com/">Cydia Impactor</a></li>
        <li>Set your nonce generator with Meridian, then run Futurerestore again</li>
        <li>When Futurerestore tries to put your device into Recovery Mode, manually put your device into said mode. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>After, Futurerestore should work just fine and the process should succeed, assuming you don't encouter any further errors.</p>
        
        <h3>On other firmwares</h3>
        <p>If you encounter this error when using Futurerestore on a device running anything above 10.x, here's how you can solve this error: </p>
        <ul>
        <li>Having <a href="https://cydia.akemi.ai/?page/net.angelxwind.noplsrecovery">NO PLS Recovery</a>, a tweak that allows tools, such as iTunes, to stop putting your device into Recovery Mode, installed on your device can cause Futurerestore's process fail, showing this error. </li>
        <li>If you're a Windows user, make sure that you connect your USB to Lightning cable on a USB port that is directly attached to your motherboard. Failing to do so can cause this error to occur. </li>
        <li>If you're using macOS, its best that you use Mojave or even Catalina, assumming you always use the latest release of Futurerestore.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Error codes -8 &amp;-10 (Unable to send iBEC/Place device into restore mode)</h2>
        <p>Regardless of your firmware, these errors can be caused by not having iTunes drivers installed correctly on your system. In order to solve this issue: </p>
        <ol>
        <li>Attempt to upgrade, downgrade, or re-restore your device and let <code>Error code -8</code> appear</li>
        <li>Head to Device manager under Control Panel (Windows)</li>
        <li><a href="https://i.imgur.com/Gg3CT7k.png">Locate "Apple Recovery (iBoot) USB Composite Device (at the bottom)</a></li>
        <li>Right click, then choose "Uninstall device". You may see a check box that allows you to uninstall the driver software as well, tick that as well</li>
        </ol>
        <p>All the three Apple mobile device entries under USB devices will disappear. At this point, unplug your device, then plug back it and attempt to restore again. If the restore still fails: </p>
        <ol>
        <li>Go back to device manager and repeat the driver uninstall process (described above)</li>
        <li><strong>DO NOT</strong> disconnect your device</li>
        <li>Go back to your terminal and attempt to run Futurerestore again. </li>
        </ol>
        <p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/zTda8in.png">The proccess should begin again and the device should restore sucessfully.</a></p>
        
        <h2>Other errors</h2>
        <p>These errors don't require for you to do much, however, they are still pretty important. If you encounter them, here's what you need to do: </p>
        <h4>Error code -20: Device nonce does not match APTicket nonce</h4>
        <ul>
        <li>This error is due to your iOS device not having the correct nonce generator that your SHSH blob provides. If Futurerestore can't authenticate your device's nonce generator and match it with the one your SHSH blob has, then the process will fail. </li>
        <li>You should try to re-set your nonce generator with a nonce setter that supports your device. Keep in mind that <strong>if you power off your device, or it powers off for any given reason, you will need to set your nonce generator again.</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Error: unable to receive message from FDRâ€¦</h4>
        <ul>
        <li>This error can be caused when using an SEP and Baseband that is <strong>not compatible</strong> with the unsigned firmware you're trying to upgrade, downgrade, or re-restore to. </li>
        <li>Make sure that you know that the SEP and Baseband you use in order to upgrade, downgrade, or re-restore is compatible with your desired unsigned firmware. </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>If your device is stuck on Recovery mode:</h4>
        <ol>
        <li>Open Command Prompt/Terminal</li>
        <li>Drag Futurerestore from your <code>futurerestore</code> folder onto your terminal</li>
        <li>Type <code>--exit-recovery</code></li>
        </ol>
        <p>In the end, your result should look something like this:</p>
        <pre><code>$ futurerestore --exit-recovery</code></pre>
        <p>This should kick your device out of Recovery Mode. Alternatively, you can use <a href="https://imazing.com">iMazing</a> to do the same in case using Futurerestore doesn't work.  </p>
        <p>If your device is stuck on the "Update Completed" screen after using Futurerestore, you can use <a href="https://imazing.com">iMazing</a> to bypass said screen.</p>
